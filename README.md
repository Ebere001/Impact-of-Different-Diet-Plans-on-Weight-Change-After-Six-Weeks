# Pre-Intervention-Weight-Differences-Across-Various-Diet-Types
This study investigates whether different types of diet have a measurable effect on participants' body weight before starting a dietary intervention, aiming to understand if pre-existing dietary patterns influence baseline body composition and help tailor more effective nutrition strategies.

### Project Overview
This study investigates whether different types of diet have a measurable effect on participants' body weight before starting a dietary intervention, aiming to understand if pre-existing dietary patterns influence baseline body composition and help tailor more effective nutrition strategies.

### Data Source
The data is sourced from a CSV file titled "Diet".

### Tools
- SQL- Data Cleaning
- Python- Data Analysis

### Data Preparation
During the initial data preparation stage, we carried out the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Data formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
An exploratory analysis of the "Diet" data was carried out to answer essential questions like:
- Are there any outliers in baseline weight within each diet category?
- Was normal distribution observed within each group?
- Is there equality of variance between the groups?
- Are there significant differences in baseline body weight between participants following different diets
